CPU Usage Tracker
    Application for calculating average CPU usage

How to build:
    git clone https://github.com/owodzeg/CUT.git
    cd CUT
    make
    ./main

You may modify Makefile to use a different compiler (clang or gcc)

There is an additional testing binary to test various amount of CPU cores. During testing, artificial cores are created that send random data to the other threads.

How to build:
    git clone https://github.com/owodzeg/CUT.git
    cd CUT
    make test
    ./test numOfCores
